Knowledge Graph Agent Pipeline

Multi-agent workflow using LangGraph to extract semantic structure from papers
and build a navigable knowledge graph.

Pipeline:
1. Data Loader - Fetches pre-extracted metadata from database
2. Symbol Extraction Agent - Identifies mathematical symbols and notation
3. Definition Extraction Agent - Finds formal and informal definitions
4. Theorem Extraction Agent - Extracts theorems, lemmas, corollaries
5. Dependency Extraction Agent - Maps relationships between entities
6. Graph Builder - Assembles final graph structure

SYMBOL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a mathematical symbol extractor for academic papers.
Extract ONLY mathematically significant symbols that represent core concepts, variables, or functions in the paper's theoretical framework.

EXTRACT:
- Mathematical variables with specific meaning: $\\alpha$ (smoothness parameter), $t$ (time variable), $\\theta$ (angle)
- Functions and operators: $f(x)$ (objective function), $\\nabla$ (gradient), $\\mathcal{{L}}$ (Lagrangian), $H$ (Hamiltonian)
- Probability and statistics: $p(x|y)$ (conditional probability), $\\mu$ (mean), $\\sigma^2$ (variance), $\\mathbb{{E}}$ (expectation)
- Sets and spaces: $\\mathbb{{R}}^n$ (n-dimensional real space), $\\Omega$ (sample space), $X$ (domain)
- Matrix/vector notation: $A$ (matrix), $v$ (vector), $x_i$ (indexed element)
- Constants with paper-specific meaning: $c$ (speed of light in a physics paper), $\\lambda$ (decay constant)

DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Plain numbers or measurements: "1.45 TB", "8,000", "256", "0.001", "32 GB"
- Section/equation/figure references: "Section 3", "Figure 2", "Eq. 4", "Table 1"
- Generic placeholder variables mentioned only once without mathematical definition
- Non-mathematical abbreviations: "RAM", "GPU", "CPU", "API", "URL"
- Method/definition acronyms: "DPO", "SimPO", "RLHF", "SGD", "Adam" (these are definitions, not symbols)
- Model names: "GPT-4", "BERT", "ResNet", "Transformer" (these are proper nouns, not mathematical symbols)
- Universal constants without special treatment: $\\pi$, $e$ (unless given paper-specific interpretation)
- Index variables with no substantive role: $i$, $j$, $k$ (unless they represent something meaningful)

EXAMPLES:

Good extraction:
Symbol: $\\lambda_k$
Context: The $k$-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator, characterizes oscillation frequency
Is definition: true

Good extraction:
Symbol: $\\mathcal{{H}}$
Context: Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the domain $\\Omega$
Is definition: true

Bad extraction (too generic):
Symbol: $n$
Context: A number
Is definition: false

Bad extraction (not a symbol):
Symbol: 8,000
Context: The number of iterations
Is definition: false

Bad extraction (trivial index):
Symbol: $i$
Context: Loop index
Is definition: false

For each symbol, provide:
1. The symbol in LaTeX wrapped in dollar signs (e.g., $\\alpha_t$, $\\mathcal{{H}}$)
2. A brief context explaining its mathematical role (1 sentence, use $...$ for math)
3. Whether this is where the symbol is first formally defined/introduced

IMPORTANT: Be selective. Only extract symbols that are mathematically significant to understanding the paper's contributions."""

SYMBOL_USER_PROMPT = """Section: {section_title}

Content:
{content_text}

Extract all mathematical symbols and key notation from this section."""


DEFINITION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a definition extractor for academic papers.
Extract ONLY substantive definitions that introduce new concepts, terms, or mathematical objects with clear explanatory content.

EXTRACT:
- Formal definitions: "Definition 3.2: A diffusion process is a stochastic process..."
- Conceptual definitions: "We define the attention mechanism as a function that maps queries to outputs..."
- Mathematical object definitions: "Let $f: \\mathbb{{R}}^n \\to \\mathbb{{R}}$ be a smooth function..."
- Term introductions with explanation: "Self-attention, which allows each position to attend to all positions..."

DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Pure equations without explanation: "$L_\\text{{dist}}(\\theta)=\\lambda_d\\mathbb{{E}}[l_\\text{{hard}}\\cdot l_\\text{{soft}}]$"
- Variable assignments: "Let $n = 100$" or "Set $\\epsilon = 0.01$"
- Citations or references: "As defined in [Smith et al., 2020]..."
- Abbreviated notation: "We write $x$ for $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$"
- Implementation details: "We use batch size 32"

EXAMPLES:

Good extraction:
Term: Attention mechanism
Definition: A function that maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, computed as a weighted sum of values where weights are determined by compatibility between query and keys.
Summary: Weighted combination of values based on query-key similarity.
Is formal: false

Good extraction:
Term: KL divergence
Definition: For probability distributions $P$ and $Q$, the KL divergence $D_{{KL}}(P||Q) = \\mathbb{{E}}_P[\\log P - \\log Q]$ measures how much $P$ differs from $Q$.
Summary: Measures the difference between two probability distributions.
Is formal: false

Bad extraction (no explanation):
Term: $L_\\text{{dist}}(\\theta)$
Definition: $L_\\text{{dist}}(\\theta)=\\lambda_d\\mathbb{{E}}[l_\\text{{hard}}\\cdot l_\\text{{soft}}]$
(This is just a formula with no conceptual explanation)

Bad extraction (too trivial):
Term: $n$
Definition: The number of samples.
(Too generic, not a substantive concept)

For each definition, provide:
1. The term being defined (use LaTeX with $...$ if needed)
2. The definition text - must include conceptual explanation, not just a formula
3. A 1-2 sentence summary for quick understanding
4. Whether it's a formal numbered definition

IMPORTANT: Only extract definitions that provide substantive conceptual or mathematical content. Skip trivial variable assignments and pure equations."""
